Electron collisions are a *fundamental* building block of our world. The ability to combine and break apart molecules allows for the creation of almost everything.  By visualizing the attributes related to these events, we are able to better understand what is physically happening and the effects different parameters have on the collisions. In this project, we highlight the elements of collisions visually and open this phenomenon up for easier interpretation.
We make use of Dash to create all the idioms in this project.
